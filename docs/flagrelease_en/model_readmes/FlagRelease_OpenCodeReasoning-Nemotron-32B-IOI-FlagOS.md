# Technical Overview
**FlagOS** is a fully open-source system software stack designed to unify the "model–system–chip" layers and foster an open, collaborative ecosystem. It enables a "develop once, run anywhere" workflow across diverse AI accelerators, unlocking hardware performance, eliminating fragmentation among vendor-specific software stacks, and substantially lowering the cost of porting and maintaining AI workloads. With core technologies such as the **FlagScale**, together with vllm-plugin-fl, distributed training/inference framework, **FlagGems** universal operator library, **FlagCX** communication library, and **FlagTree** unified compiler, the **FlagRelease** platform leverages the **FlagOS** stack to automatically produce and release various combinations of \<chip + open-source model\>. This enables efficient and automated model migration across diverse chips, opening a new chapter for large model deployment and application.
## FlagGems
FlagGems is a high-performance, generic operator library implemented in [Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) language. It is built on a collection of backend-neutral kernels that aims to accelerate LLM (Large-Language Models) training and inference across diverse hardware platforms.
## FlagTree
FlagTree is an open source, unified compiler for multiple AI chips project dedicated to developing a diverse ecosystem of AI chip compilers and related tooling platforms, thereby fostering and strengthening the upstream and downstream Triton ecosystem. Currently in its initial phase, the project aims to maintain compatibility with existing adaptation solutions while unifying the codebase to rapidly implement single-repository multi-backend support. For upstream model users, it provides unified compilation capabilities across multiple backends; for downstream chip manufacturers, it offers examples of Triton ecosystem integration.
## FlagScale and vllm-plugin-fl
Flagscale is a comprehensive toolkit designed to support the entire lifecycle of large models. It builds on the strengths of several prominent open-source projects, including [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), to provide a robust, end-to-end solution for managing and scaling large models.
vllm-plugin-fl is a vLLM plugin built on the FlagOS unified multi-chip backend, to help flagscale support multi-chip on vllm framework.
## **FlagCX**
FlagCX is a scalable and adaptive cross-chip communication library. It serves as a platform where developers, researchers, and AI engineers can collaborate on various projects, contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions, and share their work with the global community.

## **FlagEval Evaluation Framework**
 FlagEval is a comprehensive evaluation system and open platform for large models launched in 2023. It aims to establish scientific, fair, and open benchmarks, methodologies, and tools to help researchers assess model and training algorithm performance. It features:
 - **Multi-dimensional Evaluation**: Supports 800+ model evaluations across NLP, CV, Audio, and Multimodal fields, covering 20+ downstream tasks including language understanding and image-text generation.
 - **Industry-Grade Use Cases**: Has completed horizontal evaluations of mainstream large models, providing authoritative benchmarks for chip-model performance validation.
