# Overview

FlagCX is a scalable and adaptive cross-chip communication library. It serves as a platform where developers, researchers, and AI engineers can collaborate on various projects, contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions, and share their work with the global community.

FlagCX leverages native collective communication libraries to provide full single-chip communication support across platforms. Beyond its native x-CCL integrations, FlagCX introduces original device-buffer IPC and device-buffer RDMA technologies, enabling high-performance P2P operations for both cross-chip and single-chip scenarios. These mechanisms can be seamlessly combined with native x-CCL backends to deliver optimized performance for cross-chip collective communications.
